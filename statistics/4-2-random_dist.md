[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

>> 
```python
from __future__ import print_function, division

%matplotlib inline

import numpy as np

import nsfg
import first
import thinkstats2
import thinkplot
```


**Exercise:** The numbers generated by `numpy.random.random` are supposed to be uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the same probability.

Generate 1000 numbers from `numpy.random.random` and plot their PMF.  What goes wrong?

Now plot the CDF. Is the distribution uniform?


```python
# Solution 
rand = np.random.random(1000)
```


```python
# Solution 
#PMF:
pmf=thinkstats2.Pmf(rand)
thinkplot.Pmf(pmf)
thinkplot.Show(xlabel='Random num', ylabel='PMF')
#The distribution is uniform so every value has the same probability
```

```python
# Solution 
#CDF:
cdf=thinkstats2.Cdf(rand)
thinkplot.Cdf(cdf)
thinkplot.Show(xlabel='Random num', ylabel='CDF')
#Yes the distribution is uniform
```
